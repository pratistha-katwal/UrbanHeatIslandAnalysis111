'''3.2. Tensors with TensorFlow and PyTorch
You must also experiment with Tensors. In this case, perform the operations below, or repeat
the operations performed with arrays using now Tensors, and compare the performance.
Required:
• Convert raster data to tensors
• Perform tensor-based operations (e.g. convolution, aggregation, or regression)
• Demonstrate GPU awareness (even if run on CPU)
Examples:
• PyTorch tensor for raster classification
• TensorFlow tensor for spatial filtering or regression
• Comparison of NumPy vs tensor-based performance (brief)
